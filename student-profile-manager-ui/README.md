# Student Profile Manager UI

This React app provides a modern, easy-to-use interface for managing student profiles with full CRUD operations. It uses Material-UI for design and includes placeholders for API integration.

## Features
- List, add, edit, and delete student profiles
- Clean navigation and form validation
- Material-UI components for a professional look
- API placeholders for POST, PUT, GET, DELETE (replace with your backend endpoints)

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
	```sh
	npm install
	```
2. Start the development server:
	```sh
	npm start
	```
3. Replace API placeholders in `src/App.js` with your actual API calls.

## Folder Structure
- `src/App.js`: Main UI and logic
- `src/`: Other React files

## Customization
- Update form fields and API endpoints as needed for your backend.
